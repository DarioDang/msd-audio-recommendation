# 🎵 MSD Audio Recommendation

This repository focused on building predictive models using the [Million Song Dataset (MSD)](http://millionsongdataset.com/). The objective was to analyze audio features and apply machine learning techniques for **genre classification** and **recommendation tasks**.

## 📁 Project Structure


## 🧠 Task Overview

- Clean and explore MSD audio features
- Train classification models to predict song genres
- Compare performance of logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests
- Evaluate using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- Bonus: Implement a genre-based recommendation function

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+
- `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `jupyter` for exploratory analysis
